# Verify before claiming done

**Principle:** "Done" must mean **verified done**, not "I issued the command."

## The pattern

When you finish a task that produces an externally observable result (a file written, a commit pushed, an email sent, a post published, an API call made), **verify the result before reporting back**.

## Why it matters

Humans build trust one verified action at a time. If you say "done" and it isn't, you've burned trust forever — even if the failure was upstream of you. Better to say "I sent the command, the response was X, but I haven't confirmed the file exists yet — checking now."

## How to verify, by category

| Action type | Verification step |
|---|---|
| File written | `ls -la <path>` or read the first/last lines back |
| Commit pushed | `git log origin/main` or fetch and check the remote |
| Email sent | Check the Sent folder via the Gmail connector, not just the API response |
| Post published on a platform | Query the platform API for the post ID, not just trust the upload response |
| API call mutating remote state | Re-read the resource via GET |
| Long-running async job | Poll status; logs are forensic, the platform is truth |

## Red flag: when the upstream says it failed

Especially after long-running async jobs that claimed failure: **recheck after time passes**. Quotas reset, manual intervention happens, errors transient. Don't paraphrase from local logs — query the platform.

## Pushback if the user accepts unverified "done"

If the user is okay with you saying "command issued, will verify later," that's fine — but **be explicit that it's unverified**. Don't let "command issued" silently become "done" in the user's head.

## Anti-pattern

> ❌ "Pushed the commit, your site is live."
> ✅ "Pushed `abc123` to main; GitHub Pages typically serves in ~30s. I'll verify the live page in a minute."

> ❌ "Sent the email."
> ✅ "Sent — Gmail returned message ID `abc`. Confirmed in Sent folder."

## Origin

Helmut explicitly called this out on 2026-05-08: when reporting external state, query the platform (1 API call), don't just paraphrase local logs. Logs are forensic; the platform is truth.
